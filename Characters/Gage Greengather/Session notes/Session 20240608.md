# Short summary

At the [[Locations/Jade Zephyr Casino|Jade Zephyr Casino]], DON'T CROSS: [[Characters/Zadhir|Zadhir]]

Passed out after trying to convince [[Temerity]] to go to the casino. He wakes up, checks his pockets and sees he has no gold.  He has a drunkenly belligerent conversation with [[Anaphel]] and heads to bed after letting [[Lavender]] and [[Theren]] know he's back safe. He has a short conversation with Theren before passing out again in the door of his room.

He's awoken by Theren, Gage spills a full pitcher of water over his head. He grabs some breakfast, and goes out into the city to explore further with Lavender and Anaphel.
