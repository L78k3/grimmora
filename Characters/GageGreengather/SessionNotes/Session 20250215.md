Approaching Sylv Beard, see Temerity. Anaphel's taking the lead, I don't have much to say to him. I'm aligned with Theron and Lavender in this, it seems.

Ana asks Temerity to join the party. We need to find the horses. We step away to see how the chaos has developed while we were gone.

Things have calmed down a bit, the horses are still missing. We go to the warehouse to investigate
