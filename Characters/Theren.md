# General Description
Theren is a half-elf Sorcerer, who hails from the swamplands to the south of Auridon. He was a vagabond for quite some time, causing him to be fairly difficult to open up to others with his only company being his familiar pseudodragon, Runcible. His patron is currently unknown, try as Theren might to contact them. In the party, he is generally agreeable and happy to go with consensus, but he does have a tendency to want to run away sometimes, usually resulting in Lavender mediating. (see the Displaced, first fight with Zadhir).
