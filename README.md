# grimmora
 Info for Beaman's specific DnD Campaign which takes place in Grimmora

# Contents

## Characters
Pages for each character. Pretty Simple, no structure has been defined yet for these.
```dataview
LIST
FROM "Characters"
WHERE type = character
```

## Chronicles
These are produced by Tony, they are then copy-pasted into here where I can write little pages for each other note.

```dataview
TABLE
FROM "Chronicles"
SORT file.name asc
```

## Locations
Small notes about each distinct location the party visits. Examples of these are [[Arcadia]], the [[Jade Zephyr Casino]] and [[Midward]].

```dataview
LIST
FROM "Locations"
```

## Sessions
Play-by-play notes, written from Luke/Gage's perspective.

```dataview
LIST
FROM "Characters/GageGreengather/SessionNotes"
```
