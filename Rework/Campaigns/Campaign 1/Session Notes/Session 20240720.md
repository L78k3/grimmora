Got a smol drink of mead, talked to Temerity, told him he needs to be up early, then goes to bed.

He's up third, and he wants a coffee. It dos not go well at all, he leaves a note on the bar "Do *not* drink this. I am so sorry."

We make our way towards the rendezvous at the southern gate, with the knowledge that Temerity has snuck off early.

He notices the lady elf in charge, and notices how stern she is - he asks Theren if they're all like that. Theren shrugs and they move on.

On the caravan now, minus a Temerity, Gage looks around and sees nothing. He considers casting detect thoughts but thinks better of it.
