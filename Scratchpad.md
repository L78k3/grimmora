Guard armor, no particular order, have seen this person before. Don't know them personally, but would have seen them around.

I know how to get in and out of the city with sneaky spot. Walls are low enough for us to bilet bigger people over. Would have to be done in the dead of night.

Moved over to sneaky through wall, me and theron get to inn. Make a deal with the innkeeper to get a flower, to save their child. The east gate will be distracted soon after we leave, plan is to sneak the two others both past.
