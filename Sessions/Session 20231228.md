# Play-by-play
Scouting the city

Guido has a bottle of mead

Gage has let music fade into bg, discussing things

TAP DANCING RATS - gold waistcoat, gold top hats

Cirque de so-rat

Temerity given 110 gold, incredible applause

Gnomish arcane tricksters ask Tem how he did it

He shows them the bottle, Guido sticking out of it, says "try and see through this illuson"

Uses minor illusion to grow a flower out of Guido's butt

Second gnome catches him trying to stow the mead

Up in the rafters, tavern brawl ensues

17HP 

Off to Theron, want to investigate that bottle of mead

Mead is from the south, something's in the bottle

Guido has lost a thing

Rolled 13 on Arcana for ring

Snuck into servant's quarters, Theron is disguised as a servant

Want to try and get to master bedroom, find any more info out before we find the Mayor

Right: hallway, stairway down, other things
Left: stair going down, couple of rooms

Another set of stairs go up - 3rd floor

Tackle servant into office, find my officer who gives me jobs et cetera

Frolot, my employer, informed two were at the bar, bard at the front door,

As I leave with the servant still in the room, try to listen to the door, room is silent.

I go to hide again in the shadows.

I remember being in this place before - not lots, but I do know there is no where else in the main part of the manor. I've not seen them for a while, but also there was talk of this basement, I was aware of this. There is nowhere else for the people in charge of the city to be. I never really dealt with the true leaders, I only ever talked to the messenger. If they aren't in the mansion itself, where could they be?
