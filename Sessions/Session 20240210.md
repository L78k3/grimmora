Guard put their hand toward weapon at the sight of me putting my hood up.

Group order:
Temerity, Theron, Gage, Lavender

Guard does not like Temerity' graffiti on the magazines
Tem stops drawing on them, puts th sharpie away so Guido can carry on sniffing it, brings out the rapier and starts cutting origami gnomes
Tem makes a ur mom joke, guard goes into a rage and nat 1's on a punch, falls and breaks his nose

T: "Look my good man, that's my future family in there, I'm sure you don't want to annoy them, do you?" 

Big bookcase, Green curtains, letter(unfinished). Tem still outside

Orris asks Theron's asked to lose the door, which he does.

Orrise to Lavender: "How are you?"

Lav nods. "As well as I can be. Yourself?"

Orris: "You're certainly looking more experienced last we met."

Lav: "As do you."

Tem casts Zone of Truth. Rolls:
Gage: 4
Lav: 11
Theron: 17
Orris: Saved.

Orris: "I understand why you have sought me out". Lavender nods. "There is a lot of explaining to do." says Lav. "I think there is, on both sides. I think... I've missed you." Lavender: "I've missed you too."

They hug, Gage hears "Keep her safe.". Gage replies "Yes, sir."

Lavender kicks the door open

Roll a 20, not nat. I smell something very specific. It's not living. It's the unmistakable stench of undeath which was present, being as we're in arcadia(ruled by necros), but it's even stronger now.

I tell theron, Theron rolls a 24 on an acrana check. Some commotion up ahead, can't tell what it is.

5 temp HP
