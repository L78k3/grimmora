# Short summary
[[Temerity]] introduces [[Koroko]] to [[Anaphel]], discussing the greatness of the rabbit.

Anaphel points out [[Chikitika]], the wild wanderer. She suggests a slight detour around the forests of [[Avalon]] and [[Durvish City]]. There are Druids there, and surely dryads.

[[main|Gage]] explores the forests and gets lured by a swarm of Will O' the Wisps to what he can only understand as a pile of bones, atop which a skull was sat.
