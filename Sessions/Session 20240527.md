# Short summary

Gage is *pissed* at Temerity. He's feeling like a massive failure and that weighs on his conscience heavily. Temerity didn't seem to help meaningfully in any way in the last fight, and Gage hates losing fights.

Gage checks on Lavender twice, once to ask Anaphel if she is safe, and again when she wakes.
