# Short summary

Gage is *pissed* at Temerity. He's feeling like a massive failure and that weighs on his conscience heavily. Temerity didn't seem to help meaningfully in any way in the last fight, and Gage hates losing fights.

Gage checks on Lavender twice, once to ask Anaphel if she is safe, and again when she wakes. He finished the assorted cores of camp an then tries to sleep, knowing he needs the rest. But it's too difficult, usually he works to exhaustion and passes out, but his thoughts of inadequacy stop him from sleeping. (read: he's feeling caring feelings for people, which are unfamiliar to him due to him working alone for years) 

He has a chat with Anaphel about how much he has shut out feeling and emotions due to the military life he led up until now. He asks Anaphel how he can proceed. Anaphel suggests nothing but actually taking more actions. This talk seems to help, he thanks her for the advice, and Gage is able to calm his thoughts enough to get to sleep.

Gage takes the initiative and organises his pack, offering to help with anybody else looking to do the same. They travel for 3 days and arrive in Midward in mid-afternoon.

As they walk through the own, Gage spots a casino which serves as a front for seedier activities later on in the night. He notes this for later on in the evening.

10 silver for the rooms.

We get to the tavern and Gage notes to Lavender and Theron he intends to go to the casino to investigate further with Temerity.
